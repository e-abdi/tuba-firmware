CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-W v2)

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers
and to ensure that hardware developed in this way remains open.

The CERN-OHL v2 is copyright CERN 2020. Everyone is welcome to use the CERN-OHL v2
without any further authorisation. You may redistribute and/or modify this Licence
and/or the accompanying materials under the terms of the CERN Open Hardware Licence
v2 ("OHL v2") and any subsequent versions.

Licensees may copy, distribute and transmit the work under this licence, on condition
that the work is given prominent notice of the license, and any subsequent versions
are offered under the terms of the same licence.

Hardware derived from works licenced under the OHL v2 must be licenced under the OHL v2
or an open source licence which is compatible with the OHL v2 at the time of release.

The OHL v2 is a licence for hardware which attempts to protect the right of the licensee
to study, modify and manufacture the licensed hardware, while ensuring that all derived
works remain open and available to the community.

Definitions

In this licence the following terms have the following meanings:

"Licence" means the CERN-OHL v2 in the form of this document.

"Documentation" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts,
mechanical drawings, flow charts and textual descriptions, with or without flowcharts,
provided that these are issued in electronic or hardcopy form and fully describe or
represent the apparatus, machine, product, process or method concerned or necessary to
understood the Licensed Hardware fully.

"Licensed Hardware" means the apparatus, machine, product, process or method described
in the Documentation, and any subsequent versions thereof, that you manufacture,
produce, assemble or otherwise create based upon the Documentation. Licensed Hardware
specifically includes any variants, derivatives or modifications of the apparatus,
machine, product, process or method described in the Documentation.

"Source" means information such as a design file or code which can be applied to make
Licensed Hardware. Source correspondingly includes the medium on which Source is stored
and specific locations where particulars of Source can be found.

"Licensee" means any natural or legal person exercising rights and obligations under
this Licence.

"Licensor" means any natural or legal person that creates or modifies Documentation
and thereafter publishes and distributes the Licensed Hardware and Documentation or -
where Documentation is distributed separately from Licensed Hardware - distributes
Documentation; for the avoidance of doubt, Licensor includes distributors of Licensed
Hardware as well as making Licensed Hardware.

"Relevant Licence" means this Licence or any later version thereof published by CERN.

"You" refers to any Licensee.
